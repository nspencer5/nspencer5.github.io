                of Ohio. <br><br>I think I've become
                a professional at being an amateur: amateur computer scientist, movie reviewer, trumpet player, concert
                photographer, skateboarder, 3D artist, kendama pro, graphic designer, traveler, playlist curator- I'm always
                looking for anything I can add to my infinite list of hobbies.<br><br>Academically, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's of
                Science in computer science, with a specialization in computer graphics and a minor in studio art. I'm a member
                of the Honors college at The Ohio State University. Go Bucks!<br><br>Enjoy your stay on my page! Every asset and
                line of code was created by me and I hope you rock with it.</p>
